# About The Project
Welcome to my Data Analyst Exploratory Project. This initiative aims to achieve two significant objectives: to explore and extract valuable insights from a resale dataset and to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL querying and Python data cleaning techniques.

**Purpose:**
- Exploration and Data Mining: Delving into a resale dataset to uncover trends and insights. Despite the limited context and information within the dataset, the challenge lies in extracting meaningful patterns.
- Skills Demonstration: Highlighting my expertise in SQL for querying and using Python for data cleaning, showcasing my analytical capabilities and technical competence.

The project is presented as Jupyter Note book can be found here [link](EDAwithPython.ipynb)
